# twitter_sentiment_analysis
The aim of this project is to develop a neural network using python libraries. This NN will analyse tweets and detect wether if it's good or not(polarity analysis).

We use [Sentiment 140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api.

In order to analyse we use Bi-LSTM NNs and curenntly the best results comes with Word2Vec embedding.
